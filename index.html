            Hello boo boo sobrang natutuwa at masaya ako kasi anniversary natin 😍😍 Grabe ambilis no? Parang kahapon lang nagkakahiyaan pa
            tayo sa Mcdo pero ngayon nagmamahalan na tayo ayiee😚😘 Nung 2019 january ayun naglalaro lang ako ng red dead redemption 2 sa
            ps4 tas nagbrowse ako ng whisper. tas nakita ko ung post mo I felt bad kasi iniwan ka bigla dun diba? The freaking nerve of that
            jerk! Tas sa sm bf ata yun sabi mo. Tas ayun chinat na kita baybeh. Buti nagreply ka sakin boo feel ko yung first impression mo
            sa introduction ko sayo ay bolero ako at manyak hahahaha well you were right 😂🤣 Naaalala ko na nagsend ka sakin ng taiwan pics
            mo ang ganda ng pagka edit mo nun boo. Then nagsend ka sakin ng first pic mo hihihi kissable lips very kissable and cute
            🥰😘💋👄. After a week nagmeet na tayo. Nung unang pagka kita ko pa lang sayo ang ganda ganda mo mahaba buhok at very sexy lips!
            Grey sweater pa suot mo nun. Then after many dates, our love story was born! Thank you for trusting me in being your boyfriend
            boo. I was really glad you said yes to me when I asked you to be my girlfriend. I will never forget that day 😊😊Masaya talaga
            nagsimba tayo tas ang ganda ganda ng suot mo very Bea very girly and very beautiful! Kaya sana makasimba ulit tayo dun sa may
            Madison Galleries at sa Relish Cafe tayo kumain. One of these days boo huhuhu makaka food and drink dates na rin tayoo. Andami
            na ng napagusapan natin at super haba na ng convo natinnsa TG at lalo na sa messenger boo! Andaming good memories natin. May mga

            Masaya ako boo kasi after ng lang weeks na malungkot ka at feeling mising out, nakuha mo na ang Animal Crossing New Horizons
            🎊🎉🎮 Im very happy for you feel ko talaga na gustong gusto mo yung game na yun well halata naman kasi adik ka na dun boo
            huhuhu kahit nagwowork naglalaro pa rin😂🤣 Pero eto okay lang naman na maglaro ka ng nun. It is a cool and fun game I can
            relate cause you're man is also a gamer. Di ako masyado magtatampo 😏😉 Napansin ko na 5-6 pm ka na natutulog these past few
            days and honestly, Im getting worried. Lagi ng 5 hours ang tulog mo boo. Wag mo ipagpalit yung paglalaro sa tulog mo. Nightshift
            ka so mas mahirap makahanap ng tulog tapos dahil may switch ka na ngayon, nagiging distraction yan sa pagsleep mo. Ang wish ko
            lang ay sana by 6 pm natutulog ka na. Gusto ko sana yung sleep mo ay 6-8 hours. 6 hours minimum. Pwede ring magsleep ka ng mga
            afternoon tapos maglaro ka na paggising mo sa gabi boo. In conclusion, hindi kita pipigilan maglaro andito ako para suportahan
            ka. I know it's a great game boo!! Just dont play too much and dont choose playing over sleep. Sorry if I sound bossy and
            possessive I just want you to get good sleep regularly dont be mad hihihi I love you so much my hard headed woman 😘 😚😘

            straight up look at you because I'd get starstruck and melt because your eyes are just too mesmerizing. Meanwhile your eyebrows
            are always on fleek. Even if you're on bed, I can still notice their beauty. Perfect eyebrows in my opinion. Your cheeks are so
            lovely and adorable boo! I can't stop kissing your cheeks huhuhu I really miss em. They are soft and both smell good. When I
            kiss your cheeks, I can smell you good so please dont block my kisses plith 😂🤣 I won't explain any further why I'm addicted to
            kissing your cheeks. Especially now that we haven't seen each other in a while, hmmm forgive me if I kiss you too much. That's
            not a warning oki hahaha your cheeks are also perfect and they will always be my favorite part of your face forever 😊😚😘 Of
            course I won't forget your adorable nose! They are so cute too boo! Your lips your kissable kissable lips 💋👄 I love em too.
            Your lips taste sweet that's why I wanna kiss em too every time. Not only do they look beautiful your lips look adorable too
            especially when you take a selfie with my best favorite angle in the world 😍😍🥰❤️💕 Add them all up together and you got
            yourself a gorgeous adorable kind hearted face I love very much. When you smile, all of the parts of your face compliment each
            other resulting to a face of an angel. I love you I love you I love you and I am not afraid to scream that to the world😚😘 The
            next time you think you're unattractive, just read the sentences above. You will remain beautiful and cute even if you get old.

            countless reasons why I love you my boo boo! You are so kind, gentle, honest, generous, forgiving, considerate and lovely. I can
            still list more good inner traits from you but I know you know them already yourself 😉 I love you because you make me happy

            me even if I always give corny jokes. You love my imperfections, my bad habits and bad behavior. I may not be the perfect
            boyfriend but I am always doing my best to become the best man in your life 😚😘 Tell me all the things you notice that I need
            to improve on. I appreciate it when you notice my flaws so that I can correct them immediately. That really helps. You make me a
